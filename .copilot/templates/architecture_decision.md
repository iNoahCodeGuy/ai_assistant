**Purpose**: Structured framework for making architecture decisions

**Usage**: Copy this template into AI chat, replace [PLACEHOLDERS] with actual values

---

## Prompt Template

```
Need to make an architecture decision about [TOPIC].

## Context to Load

Please reference these documents:
- docs/context/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md (current architecture)
- docs/LANGGRAPH_ALIGNMENT.md (LangGraph best practices, migration roadmap)
- docs/QA_STRATEGY.md (design principles, quality standards)
- docs/RAG_ENGINE.md (RAG implementation patterns)
- WEEK_1_LAUNCH_GAMEPLAN.md (timeline constraints, Week 1 stability priority)
- https://github.com/techwithtim/LangGraph-Tutorial.git (reference implementation)

## Decision Context

**Topic**: [ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_TOPIC]

**Current State**:
[Describe how it works now]

**Problem/Opportunity**:
[What's not working or what could be improved?]

**Constraints**:
- Timeline: [Week 1 launch / Week 2 optimization / No rush]
- Risk tolerance: [High / Medium / Low]
- Reversibility: [Easily reversible / Requires migration / One-way]
- Team familiarity: [Well-known pattern / New pattern / Experimental]

## Decision Criteria

Please evaluate options based on:

### 1. Design Principles (from QA_STRATEGY.md)
- **Cohesion & SRP**: Does it maintain single responsibility?
- **Encapsulation**: Does it hide implementation details?
- **Loose Coupling**: Can components be swapped independently?
- **Reusability**: Can code/patterns be reused elsewhere?
- **Portability**: Does it work across environments (local, Vercel, Streamlit)?
- **Defensibility**: Does it handle errors gracefully?
- **Maintainability**: Is it easy to understand and modify?
- **Simplicity (KISS/DRY/YAGNI)**: Is it the simplest solution that works?

### 2. LangGraph Alignment (from LANGGRAPH_ALIGNMENT.md)
- Does it follow LangGraph best practices?
- Is it compatible with future StateGraph migration?
- Does it align with official patterns from tutorial repo?

### 3. Performance
- What's the impact on p95 latency?
- Does it add new API calls or database queries?
- Can it be cached or optimized?

### 4. Testability
- Can it be unit tested?
- Does it require complex mocking?
- Does it maintain current test coverage?

### 5. Risk Assessment
- What's the blast radius if it fails?
- Is it easily reversible?
- Does it require database migrations?
- Does it break existing functionality?

## Expected Analysis

- [ ] [Criterion 3]

### 5. Documentation Updates

Files to update:

## Alignment Check

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] Follows all 8 design principles (or documents tradeoffs)
- [ ] Aligns with LangGraph best practices (or plans migration)
- [ ] Maintains p95 latency < 3s (or has optimization plan)
- [ ] Preserves 95%+ test coverage (or adds new tests)
- [ ] Compatible with Week 1 launch timeline (or defers to Week 2+)

## Additional Notes

[Any other context, stakeholder input, or constraints]

## Example: StateGraph Migration Decision

```
Need to make an architecture decision about migrating to LangGraph StateGraph.

## Context to Load

Please reference these documents:
- docs/context/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md (current architecture)
- docs/LANGGRAPH_ALIGNMENT.md (comparison, migration plan)
- docs/QA_STRATEGY.md (design principles)
- WEEK_1_LAUNCH_GAMEPLAN.md (Week 1 stability priority)
- https://github.com/techwithtim/LangGraph-Tutorial.git (StateGraph patterns)

## Decision Context

**Topic**: When to migrate from manual TypedDict pipeline to StateGraph class

**Current State**:
- We have a functional TypedDict-based pipeline
- Nodes are called sequentially in conversation_flow.py
- 74/74 tests passing (100%)
- System is stable and well-understood

**Problem/Opportunity**:
- Not using official LangGraph StateGraph pattern
- Missing benefits: graph visualization, conditional routing, parallel execution
- Future features (checkpointing) may require StateGraph

**Constraints**:
- Timeline: Week 1 launch in 7 days (Oct 26, 2025)
- Risk tolerance: Low (close to launch deadline)
- Reversibility: Medium (would require reverting commits, re-running tests)
- Team familiarity: Medium (TypedDict familiar, StateGraph new pattern)

## Decision Criteria

[Same as template above]

## Expected Analysis

### 1. Options Analysis

**Option A: Migrate Now (Week 1)**
- **Description**: Convert to StateGraph before launch
- **Pros**: Launch with best practices, no technical debt
- **Cons**: Risk close to deadline, could introduce bugs, team learning curve
- **Design Principles**: Maintainability (+), Simplicity (-)
- **Effort**: 4-6 hours
- **Risk**: High (close to launch)

**Option B: Migrate Post-Launch (Week 2)**
- **Description**: Launch with current TypedDict, migrate Week 2
- **Pros**: Low risk for launch, time to test migration thoroughly
- **Cons**: Ships with "non-standard" pattern, requires post-launch work
- **Design Principles**: Reliability (+), Simplicity (+)
- **Effort**: 4-6 hours (but post-launch)
- **Risk**: Low (stable launch, controlled migration)

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- **Description**: Add StateGraph wrapper around existing TypedDict nodes
- **Pros**: Gets StateGraph benefits without rewriting nodes
- **Cons**: More complex, adds abstraction layer
- **Design Principles**: Simplicity (-), Encapsulation (+)
- **Effort**: 6-8 hours
- **Risk**: Medium (additional complexity)

### 2. Recommendation

**Recommended Approach**: Option B (Migrate Post-Launch in Week 2)

**Rationale**:
1. **Week 1 priority is stable launch**: Current implementation works (74/74 tests passing), don't introduce risk
2. **Week 2 has buffer time**: Post-launch allows thorough testing without deadline pressure
3. **Aligns with design principles**: Reliability > Premature optimization
4. **Still following LangGraph patterns**: TypedDict state + functional nodes are correct, just not using builder

**Timeline**:
- **Week 1 (Oct 19-26)**: Keep current implementation, focus on frontend + deployment
- **Week 2 (Oct 27-Nov 2)**: Migrate to StateGraph (4-6 hours), test thoroughly, deploy
- **Week 3+**: Add advanced features (conditional routing, parallel execution)

### 3. Migration Path (Week 2)

**Phase 1: Preparation** (1 hour)
- Install `langgraph` package
- Review StateGraph documentation
- Create feature branch `feature/state-graph-migration`

**Phase 2: Implementation** (3-4 hours)
- Create StateGraph instance
- Convert node additions (add_node, add_edge)
- Replace manual pipeline with graph.compile()
- Update conversation_flow.py

**Phase 3: Validation** (1-2 hours)
- Run full test suite (should pass unchanged)
- Manual testing of all 5 roles
- Performance benchmarking (verify latency unchanged)

**Phase 4: Cleanup** (30 min)
- Remove manual pipeline code
- Update documentation
- Deploy to production

**Estimated Time**: 6 hours total
**Risk Level**: Low (post-launch, no deadline pressure)

### 4. Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**: All existing tests should pass unchanged (nodes unchanged)
**Integration Tests**: conversation_flow tests verify end-to-end behavior
**Manual Testing**: Test all 5 roles with representative queries

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All 74 tests passing
- [ ] p95 latency unchanged (< 3s)
- [ ] All 5 roles work correctly
- [ ] No regressions in conversation quality

### 5. Documentation Updates

Files to update:
- [ ] docs/LANGGRAPH_ALIGNMENT.md (mark migration complete)
- [ ] docs/context/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md (update flow diagram)
- [ ] CONTINUE_HERE.md (new status)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md (Week 2 migration entry)

## Alignment Check

- [x] Follows design principles: Reliability, Simplicity (launch stable first)
- [x] Aligns with LangGraph: TypedDict â†’ StateGraph is planned path
- [x] Maintains performance: No expected latency impact
- [x] Preserves tests: All tests pass unchanged
- [x] Compatible with Week 1: Defers to Week 2, no launch risk

## Additional Notes

- User explicitly requested LangGraph alignment
- LANGGRAPH_ALIGNMENT.md already documents this decision
- Week 1 gameplan prioritizes stability over optimization
- Reference implementation (LangGraph Tutorial) available for guidance

### 2. Use Objective Criteria
- Reference design principles explicitly
- Measure impact (latency, test coverage, effort)
- Note alignment with documented standards

### 3. Consider Timeline
- Week 1 = stability priority
- Week 2+ = optimization allowed
- Multi-phase for complex changes

### 4. Document Tradeoffs
- Every decision has pros/cons
- Be honest about technical debt
- Note future work needed

### 5. Get Team Buy-In
