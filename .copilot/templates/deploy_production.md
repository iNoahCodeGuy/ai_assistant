## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Final Verification (30 min)
```bash
# Run full test suite
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src

# Build frontend
npm run build

# Check for hardcoded values
grep -r "sk-proj" src/ api/  # Should be empty
grep -r "localhost" src/ api/  # Should be empty (except dev configs)

# Verify git status clean
git status  # No uncommitted changes
```

### Step 2: Deploy Backend (Vercel) (15 min)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not already)
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Verify deployment
curl https://[your-app].vercel.app/api/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy", ...}
```

### Step 3: Configure Custom Domain (Vercel) (30 min)
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ [Project] â†’ Settings â†’ Domains
2. Add domain: [your-domain.com]
3. Copy DNS records (A record or CNAME)
4. Go to GoDaddy â†’ DNS Management
5. Add records:
   - Type: CNAME
   - Name: @ (or subdomain)
   - Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
   - TTL: 600
6. Wait for DNS propagation (15-30 min)
7. Verify SSL certificate auto-provisioned (Vercel does this automatically)

### Step 4: Test Production Deployment (15 min)
```bash
# Test API endpoints
curl https://[your-domain.com]/api/health
curl -X POST https://[your-domain.com]/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role": "software_developer", "query": "Hello", "session_id": "test"}'

# Test frontend
open https://[your-domain.com]
# 1. Select role
# 2. Send test message
# 3. Verify response appears
# 4. Check browser console for errors
```

### Step 5: Smoke Tests (30 min)
Run through critical user journeys:

**Journey 1: Software Developer**
1. Visit site â†’ Select "Software Developer" role
2. Send: "How does the RAG pipeline work?"
3. Verify: Response includes technical details
4. Send: "Show me the code"
5. Verify: Code snippets appear

**Journey 2: Hiring Manager (Technical)**
1. Visit site â†’ Select "Hiring Manager (Technical)" role
2. Send: "Tell me about Noah's experience with Python"
3. Verify: Career details appear
4. Send: "Can I get your resume?"
5. Verify: Email collection prompt appears
6. Enter test email â†’ Verify resume sent (check email)

**Journey 3: Analytics Display**
1. Select any role
2. Send: "Display data analytics"
3. Verify: Live analytics dashboard appears with tables

**Journey 4: Error Handling**
1. Send empty message â†’ Verify graceful error message
2. Send very long message (> 2000 chars) â†’ Verify truncation or error
3. Rapid-fire 10 messages â†’ Verify no crashes

### Step 6: Monitor Initial Traffic (2 hours)
- Check Vercel logs for errors
- Check LangSmith traces for failures
- Monitor API latency (p95 should be < 3s)
- Watch for any 500 errors

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues found:

### Quick Rollback (Vercel)
```bash
# Revert to previous deployment
vercel rollback

# Or redeploy previous commit
git checkout [previous-commit-hash]
vercel --prod
```

### Emergency Maintenance Mode
```python
# In api/chat.py, add at top of handler:
return {
    "answer": "Portfolia is temporarily down for maintenance. Check back soon!",
    "success": False
}
```
