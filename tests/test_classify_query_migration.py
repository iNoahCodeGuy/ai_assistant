"""Tests for classify_query node migration to TypedDict pattern.

This test suite validates that classify_query follows LangGraph patterns:
1. Accepts ConversationState (TypedDict)
2. Returns Dict[str, Any] (partial update)
3. Implements fail-fast validation
4. Doesn't mutate input state
5. Returns only modified fields

This is the POC migration test - once this passes, we can migrate remaining nodes.
