"""Comprehensive error handling tests.

Tests graceful degradation across all system components:
- Service layer failures (Twilio, Resend, Supabase unavailable)
- LLM API failures (OpenAI rate limits, outages)
- Input validation (XSS, SQL injection, length limits)
- API validation (malformed JSON, missing fields)
