"""Test system prompt consistency and retrieval grounding.

Validates that:
1. System prompt structure matches documented format
2. RAG retrieval returns relevant context for sample queries (QA requirement)
3. Generated answers are grounded in retrieved chunks
4. Role-specific prompts maintain consistent tone

QA Acceptance Criteria (from gameplan):
- RAG returns grounded citations for 3 sample prompts
- Role behavior unchanged (developer, HM-technical, HM-nontechnical, explorer)

Design Principles:
- Reliability (#4): Ensures RAG quality maintained
- Consistency (#2): Role tone validation
- Observability: Logs retrieval performance metrics

Run: pytest tests/test_prompt_consistency.py -v

Last Updated: October 19, 2025
Status: 🆕 New test suite for Week 1 launch
