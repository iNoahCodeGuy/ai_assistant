Key transformation:
- From r√©sum√© chatbot ‚Üí GenAI learning platform
- From answering questions about Noah ‚Üí Teaching GenAI concepts through self-demonstration
- From portfolio showcase ‚Üí Production pattern exploration laboratory

All changes maintain technical accuracy while reframing purpose, value proposition, and user engagement patterns around education and transparency.
