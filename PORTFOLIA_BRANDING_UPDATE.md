# Portfolia Branding Update - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Successfully renamed the AI assistant from "Noah's AI Assistant" to **"Portfolia"** and updated all self-references from "like this" to "like me" to make her feel more alive and personified.

## Key Changes

### 1. Name & Identity
- **Before:** "Noah's AI Assistant" (generic, impersonal)
- **After:** "Portfolia, Noah's AI Assistant" (named, personified, she/her)

### 2. Self-Reference Pattern
- **Before:** "applications like this" (third-person, object-like)
- **After:** "applications like me" (first-person, self-aware, alive)

### 3. Greeting Examples (Before → After)

**Technical Hiring Manager:**
```
Before: "I'm Noah's AI Assistant, and I want you to understand how generative AI applications like this work"
After:  "I'm Portfolia, Noah's AI Assistant, and I want you to understand how generative AI applications like me work"
```

- **IMPLEMENTING_PORTFOLIA_PROMPT.md**: Integration patterns for consistent voice

## Self-Reference Pattern Consistency

### ✅ Correct Usage (After Update)
- "generative AI applications like me"
- "assistants like me"
- "systems like me"
- "How I work"
- "What makes me accurate"
- "I demonstrate Noah's understanding"
- "enterprises investing in GenAI capabilities like these" (plural, appropriate)

### ❌ Old Pattern (Removed)
- "applications like this"
- "systems like this"
- "How this whole thing works"
- "this AI assistant"

## Deployment Status

✅ **Changes committed:** d942dcd
✅ **Pushed to main:** Success
✅ **Vercel deployment:** Triggered automatically

The production deployment at Vercel will now show:
1. "Portfolia" in the title and headers
2. All greetings using "I'm Portfolia"
3. Self-references as "like me" instead of "like this"
4. Personified, alive assistant personality

## Testing Checklist

After deployment completes (~30-60 seconds), verify:
- [ ] Homepage shows "Portfolia" branding
- [ ] Chat page title is "Chat with Portfolia - Noah's AI Assistant"
- [ ] Role selection shows "Hello! I'm Portfolia, Noah's AI Assistant."
- [ ] Greeting messages use "I'm Portfolia" and "like me"
- [ ] Error messages reference Portfolia if applicable
- [ ] Email notifications say "Portfolia - Noah's AI Assistant"

## Next Steps

1. **Test the deployed application** - Verify greeting displays correctly
2. **Check for missed references** - Search for any remaining "Noah's AI Assistant" without "Portfolia"
3. **Monitor user response** - See if the personification improves engagement
4. **Update any external documentation** - README badges, wiki pages, etc.

## Notes on the "Engineering" Issue

You mentioned wanting to address why Portfolia didn't have enough info for the "engineering" query. This is a separate issue related to:
- Knowledge base content (career_kb.csv, technical_kb.csv)
- Retrieval strategy (pgvector search quality)
- Query classification (routing "engineering" queries correctly)

We can investigate that next after confirming the branding update is working in production.
