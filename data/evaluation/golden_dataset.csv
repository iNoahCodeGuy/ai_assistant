Hiring Manager (technical),"What experience does Noah have with LangChain?","Noah has hands-on experience building RAG applications with LangChain, including pgvector integration, prompt engineering, and LangSmith observability for this AI assistant project.","Should mention: LangChain, RAG, practical implementation, observability. Should be technical but professional."
Hiring Manager (technical),"Tell me about Noah's Python skills","Noah has strong Python skills demonstrated through: RAG pipeline development, FastAPI/Streamlit applications, data processing with pandas, and integration with AI services (OpenAI, Supabase).","Should mention: specific Python frameworks, practical projects, production experience"
Hiring Manager (nontechnical),"What makes Noah a good fit for our team?","Noah brings a unique combination of technical expertise in AI/ML and strong customer empathy from his SiriusXM background. He's skilled at translating complex technical concepts into business value.","Should emphasize: business impact, communication skills, customer focus. Minimal technical jargon."
Hiring Manager (nontechnical),"What's Noah's leadership experience?","Noah has experience leading cross-functional projects at SiriusXM, collaborating with product, engineering, and customer success teams to deliver features that improved user satisfaction.","Should focus on: collaboration, project leadership, business outcomes. Professional tone."
Software Developer,"Show me Noah's code for the RAG pipeline","Noah's RAG implementation uses Supabase pgvector for retrieval, LangChain for orchestration, and includes re-ranking with semantic similarity. Key modules: rag_engine.py (retrieval logic), conversation_flow.py (LangGraph pipeline), pgvector_retriever.py (vector search).","Should include: code references, architecture details, technical implementation specifics"
Software Developer,"How does Noah handle error scenarios in his code?","Noah implements comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation - services return None if unavailable rather than crashing. All nodes have try/except blocks, logging at multiple levels, and the system continues with reduced functionality if optional services fail.","Should discuss: error patterns, graceful degradation, logging strategy, resilience"
Just looking around,"What's something interesting about Noah?","Noah is a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu purple belt and active MMA fan! He brings the same discipline and continuous improvement mindset from martial arts to his software engineering practice.","Should be: engaging, personal but professional, shows personality without being overly casual"
Just looking around,"What does Noah do for fun?","Beyond coding, Noah trains Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (purple belt), follows MMA/UFC events, and loves exploring new AI technologies through hands-on projects. He's always building something new!","Should be: warm, conversational, authentic. Include personal interests with professional connection."
Software Developer,"What's Noah's approach to testing?","Noah implements comprehensive testing strategies including unit tests with pytest, integration tests for API endpoints, and evaluation pipelines for RAG quality. He uses LangSmith for monitoring LLM performance in production.","Should mention: testing frameworks, specific approaches, production monitoring"
Hiring Manager (technical),"Has Noah worked with vector databases?","Yes, Noah has production experience with Supabase pgvector for semantic search in RAG applications. He's implemented hybrid search combining vector similarity with keyword matching, and optimized retrieval performance through re-ranking and deduplication.","Should include: specific technology (pgvector), use case, optimization techniques"
