# Proactive Display Intelligence Summary

## What Changed

Portfolia now **proactively** shows code and data when it would enhance understanding, not just when explicitly requested.

## Before vs After

### Scenario 1: Technical User Asks About RAG

**Query:** "How does RAG work?"

**Before:**
- ✅ Detailed explanation of RAG
- ❌ No code shown (user didn't say "show me code")

**After (Software Developer role):**
- ✅ Detailed explanation of RAG
- ✅ **Proactive code snippet** showing retrieval logic (~30 lines)
- ✅ Comments explaining key design decisions

**After (Nontechnical role):**
- ✅ Accessible explanation
- ❌ No code (respects non-technical audience)

---

### Scenario 2: User Asks About Usage

**Query:** "How many users interact with you daily?"

**Before:**
- ✅ Explanation of typical usage patterns
- ❌ No actual data shown

**After (Any role):**
- ✅ Brief context
- ✅ **Proactive usage statistics table** from Supabase
- ✅ Source attribution

---

### Scenario 3: Technical Question About Architecture

**Query:** "Explain your vector search approach"

**Before:**
- ✅ Explanation of semantic search
- ❌ No implementation details

**After (Technical roles):**
- ✅ Explanation of semantic search
- ✅ **Proactive pgvector query code** showing similarity search
- ✅ Comments on embedding strategy

---

## Implementation Details

### Code Proactivity Triggers

Code is **proactively** shown when:
1. **Role is technical** (Software Developer, Hiring Manager technical)
2. **Query mentions implementation topics:**
   - RAG pipeline, vector search, retrieval, embedding, orchestration
   - LangGraph, conversation flow, nodes, pipeline patterns
   - API routes, endpoints, functions, classes
   - pgvector, Supabase queries, database migrations
   - Prompt engineering, LLM calls, generation logic

### Data Proactivity Triggers

Data/analytics are **proactively** shown when:
1. **Any role** (metrics help everyone)
2. **Query implies measurements:**
   - "how many", "how much", "how often", "frequency"
   - "performance", "metrics", "statistics", "stats"
   - "trend", "pattern", "over time", "growth"
   - "most common", "popular", "typical", "average"
   - "compare", "vs", "difference between"

## Key Principles

### 1. Role-Aware Proactivity
- **Technical roles:** Get code examples proactively
- **Non-technical roles:** Get explanations without code (unless they ask)
- **All roles:** Get data/metrics when questions imply numbers

### 2. Explicit > Proactive
- If user says "show me code" → Always show code
- If user doesn't ask but code would help → Show code (technical roles only)
- Distinction maintained in LLM instructions

### 3. Teaching-Focused
- Aligns with Portfolia's GenAI educator persona
- Code includes comments explaining decisions
- Data includes source attribution
- Goal: Help users understand, not just answer

### 4. Quality Limits
- Code snippets: ≤40 lines
- Focus on most interesting/relevant parts
- Comments explain why, not just what
- Data: Clean tables with proper formatting

---

## Alignment with Master Docs

✅ **PROJECT_REFERENCE_OVERVIEW.md:**
> "proactively displays code snippets (≤40 lines) when they clarify concepts"

✅ **DATA_COLLECTION_AND_SCHEMA_REFERENCE.md:**
> "If user is technical and seems unsure → proactively show a small code snippet (≤40 lines) with comments"

✅ **CONVERSATION_PERSONALITY.md:**
> "I want you to understand how generative AI applications like me work"
> "Teach GenAI concepts, don't just answer"

## Testing Examples

Try these queries to see proactive display:

### Code Proactivity (as Software Developer)
1. "How does RAG work?"
2. "Explain your vector search"
3. "How did you implement the conversation flow?"
4. "What's your LangGraph orchestration pattern?"

### Data Proactivity (any role)
1. "How many people use this daily?"
2. "What's the performance trend?"
3. "How often do people ask about RAG?"
4. "Show me typical user engagement"

### No Proactivity (control)
1. "Tell me about Noah's background" → Narrative only
2. "What's your favorite feature?" → Conversational, no code/data

---

## Production Impact

- **Token overhead:** ~50-100 tokens per request (instructions)
- **API calls:** No change (same LLM request, better guidance)
- **User experience:** Significant improvement for technical learners
- **Alignment:** Full compliance with master documentation

---

## Future Enhancements

Possible additions:
1. **Diagram proactivity:** Show architecture diagrams for system questions
2. **Adaptive code length:** Shorter snippets for simple questions, longer for deep dives
3. **Multi-modal proactivity:** Offer "Would you like to see [code/diagram/data]?" follow-ups
4. **Learning feedback:** Track which proactive displays users find helpful

---

**Bottom line:** Portfolia is now a **proactive teacher**, not just a reactive answerer. She anticipates when code or data would enhance understanding and includes them naturally, aligned with her GenAI educator personality.
