# Implementation Documentation

This directory contains historical reports documenting major system milestones and feature implementations.

## Purpose

Implementation reports capture:
- What was built and when
- How features were implemented
- Completion status and verification
- Team knowledge at specific points in time

## Contents

- **SYSTEM_COMPLETION_REPORT_2025-10.md**: Complete system as case study implementation (Oct 2025)
- Future milestone reports will be added here

## Naming Convention

`[FEATURE]_[TYPE]_YYYY-MM.md`

Examples:
- `SYSTEM_COMPLETION_REPORT_2025-10.md`
- `PERSONALITY_IMPLEMENTATION_2025-09.md`
- `RAG_PIPELINE_IMPLEMENTATION_2025-09.md`

## How to Use

- **Learning project history?** → Read reports chronologically
- **Understanding feature evolution?** → Find relevant implementation report
- **Documenting new milestone?** → Create new report following existing format

## Difference from CHANGELOG.md

| CHANGELOG.md | Implementation Reports |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Brief entries (1-3 lines per feature) | Detailed documentation (100-500 lines) |
| All changes in one file | Separate file per major milestone |
| Quick reference | Deep context |
| Ongoing updates | Snapshot in time |

## Format

Each implementation report should include:
1. **Date and Context**: When was this implemented? What prompted it?
2. **Goals**: What were we trying to achieve?
3. **Implementation Details**: How was it built? (architecture, code structure, design decisions)
4. **Verification**: How did we test it? What were the results?
5. **Impact**: What changed for users? For the codebase?
6. **Future Work**: What's left to do? What could be improved?

- **Feature Docs**: Ongoing reference for specific features (`docs/features/`)
- **Master Docs**: Current authoritative specs (`docs/context/`)
