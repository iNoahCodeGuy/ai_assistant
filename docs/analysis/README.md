# Analysis Documentation

This directory contains detailed technical analyses and investigations that informed architectural decisions.

## Purpose

When we make significant technical choices (e.g., "Why Vercel over self-hosted?", "Why pgvector over Pinecone?"), the full investigation and reasoning is documented here.

## Contents

- **STREAMLIT_VS_VERCEL.md**: Deployment platform comparison and rationale
- **VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_DISCOVERY.md**: Vercel serverless investigation and setup
- **KNOWLEDGE_BASE_FRESHNESS.md**: KB maintenance strategy analysis
- **CODE_READABILITY_COMPARISON.md**: Code style and readability decisions

## How to Use

- **Quick answer needed?** → See `docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` for summary
- **Deep dive needed?** → Read full analysis document here
- **Making new decision?** → Create new analysis doc following existing format

## Format

Each analysis should include:
1. **Context**: What problem/question prompted this analysis?
2. **Options Evaluated**: What alternatives were considered?
3. **Criteria**: How did we evaluate options? (cost, complexity, maintainability, etc.)
4. **Analysis**: Detailed comparison of options
5. **Decision**: What we chose and why
6. **Trade-offs**: What we gave up, what we gained
7. **Date**: When decision was made (decisions can change as technology evolves)
