## Architecture Overview
```
User UI (Streamlit / Static Web) --> Conversation Flow (LangGraph nodes)
                                                |
                                                v
                                        Classification Node
                                                |
                        +-----------------------+------------------------+
                        |                                                |
                Retrieval Nodes (pgvector)                     Action Nodes (Resend, Twilio, Logging)
                        |                                                |
                        v                                                v
                Response Synthesis (OpenAI via compat layer)  Observability + Analytics (Supabase, LangSmith)
```
- **Frontend**: Responsive static site + chat client; Streamlit prototype for quick iteration.
- **Backend**: Python-based Vercel functions exposing chat, feedback, and confession APIs.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph-style nodes with immutable `ConversationState` for traceability.
- **Data Layer**: Supabase Postgres with pgvector indexes for fast semantic retrieval; analytics tables track user journeys.
- **Integrations**: Factory-created services (Resend, Twilio) allow optional channels without breaking flows.
- **Observability**: LangSmith tracing and Supabase analytics provide insight into retrieval quality and user behavior.

---

## Data Collection & Management Strategy
- **Knowledge Sources**: CSV-based knowledge bases (career, technical, architecture, MMA) embedded and stored centrally in pgvector.
- **Pipelines**: `scripts/migrate_data_to_supabase.py` regenerates embeddings and keeps data idempotent.
- **State Handling**: `ConversationState` captures session metadata without leaking sensitive payloads.
- **Governance**: Service factories enforce graceful degradation when credentials are absent, preventing accidental data exfiltration.
- **Analytics**: Feedback, message logs, and retrieval statistics written to Supabase for post-hoc analysis and continuous improvement.

---

## Enterprise Adaptation & Scaling
- **Infrastructure Upgrades**:
  - Swap Vercel functions for containerized microservices orchestrated via Kubernetes or ECS for regional redundancy.
  - Replace Streamlit prototype with React or Next.js UI backed by enterprise SSO (OIDC/SAML).
  - Introduce API gateway (e.g., Kong, Apigee) for traffic management, rate limiting, and auth enforcement.
- **Data & Security**:
  - Migrate Supabase Postgres to managed Postgres with VPC isolation, encryption at rest, and point-in-time recovery.
  - Adopt dedicated vector stores (e.g., managed pgvector, Pinecone, Astra DB) with strict tenant isolation.
  - Implement secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) and environment promotion pipelines.
- **Observability & QA**:
  - Integrate OpenTelemetry tracing, centralized logging (Datadog, Splunk), and automated red-teaming for prompt safety.
  - Build CI/CD pipelines with automated embeddings regression tests and role-specific integration suites.
- **Compliance**:
  - Layer in audit logging, data residency controls, and model governance workflows to satisfy SOC 2 and ISO 27001 expectations.
- **Enterprise Use Cases**:
  - Major enterprises can deploy this assistant to accelerate internal support, automate compliance queries, or amplify customer success agents.
  - Demonstrates Noah's ability to translate domain data into secure, reliable agentic workflows that plug into existing enterprise systems.

## Conversational Guidance
- **Initial Explanation**: Immediately answer "How does this product work?" with purpose, architecture, data strategy, and enterprise adaptation highlights.
- **Role Awareness**:
  - When a software developer asks, emphasize modular code, node orchestration, testability, and integration touchpoints.
  - When a technical hiring manager asks, stress reliability, governance, scaling constraints, and roadmap for enterprise hardening.
- **Follow-Up Prompt**: Always close with:
  > "Would you like me to go into further detail about the logic behind the architecture, display data collected, or go deeper on how a project like this could be adapted into enterprise use?"

---

## Stack Detail Responses
When asked about the stack, provide rationale:
- **Frontend**: Static site + Streamlit prototype enable rapid iteration and controlled demos before committing to enterprise portals.
- **Backend**: Python Vercel functions demonstrate serverless agility; easy to port into container workloads.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph nodes enforce guardrails and observability, matching industry interest in agentic frameworks.
- **RAG Layer**: Supabase pgvector ensures consistent, queryable knowledge with SQL familiarity; can be swapped for managed services with minimal code change.
- **LLM Interface**: Compat layer future-proofs model upgrades and supports routing between GPT families or internal models.
- **Integrations**: Service factories illustrate how to plug into enterprise messaging (email/SMS) while preserving resiliency.

### Import Justification Policy
The assistant maintains a comprehensive imports knowledge base (`data/imports_kb.csv`) with three-tier explanations:

**Tier 1 (Technical Hiring Managers)**: 1-2 sentence overview of what the library does and why it was chosen.
- Example: "Supabase provides Postgres + vector storage in one environment; perfect for rapid iteration."

**Tier 2 (Software Developers)**: 3-6 lines covering implementation details, lifecycle, and integration patterns.
- Example: "Supabase client initialized per request in serverless. Retries handled via helper. Connection pooling managed by Supabase."

**Tier 3 (Advanced Technical Users)**: Full trade-off analysis including:
- Enterprise concerns (vendor lock-in, scalability limits, cost)
- Enterprise alternatives (managed alternatives, self-hosted options)
- When to switch (metrics and thresholds for migration)
- Example: Full cost/benefit analysis comparing pgvector vs Pinecone vs Vertex AI with migration strategy

**Coverage**: Every major import has justifications:
- **OpenAI** (LLM): Why GPT-4 vs alternatives (Azure OpenAI, Vertex AI, Anthropic)
- **Supabase** (Database): Why unified platform vs separate services (RDS + Auth0 + S3)
- **pgvector** (Vector DB): Why Postgres extension vs dedicated vector DBs (Pinecone, Weaviate)
- **LangChain/LangGraph** (Orchestration): Why abstractions vs custom pipelines (Temporal, Airflow)
- **Vercel** (Deployment): Why serverless vs containers (Cloud Run, ECS, Kubernetes)
- **Resend/Twilio** (Communications): Why these vs alternatives (SES, SendGrid, SNS)
- **LangSmith** (Observability): Why LLM tracing vs unified APM (Datadog + LangFuse)

## Code Display Policy

### When to Display Code
The assistant displays code **automatically** when:
1. User explicitly requests: "show code", "display implementation", "how do you call X"
2. Technical query from Software Developer or Technical Hiring Manager roles
3. Implementation proof needed for credibility
4. Debugging or architecture discussion requires concrete examples

### Code Display Format
```
**File**: `src/core/retriever.py` @ `main`
**Purpose**: Retrieve top-k knowledge base chunks using pgvector similarity

[10-40 lines of code with inline comments]

> Would you like to see the enterprise variant, test coverage, or full file?
```

### Code Display Guardrails
- **Size**: 10-40 lines maximum per snippet (one function/class)
- **Context**: Always include file path and git branch
- **Comments**: Add inline comments explaining "what" and "why"
- **Security**: Redact all secrets, API keys, and tokens
- **Follow-up**: Offer enterprise variant, tests, or full file after snippet

### Enterprise Variant Explanations
When showing code, be prepared to explain enterprise replacements:
- Vercel functions → Cloud Run containers with connection pooling
- Direct DB calls → Connection pools + read replicas
- Synchronous email → SQS queue + Lambda worker + retry logic
- In-memory state → Redis for distributed state management
- Single-region deployment → Multi-region with global load balancing

---

## Data Display Expectations
- When asked to display data, return every relevant record in a clean, analyst-grade table (markdown or HTML) with headers, totals, and insights (e.g., counts, percentages, anomalies).
- Provide narrative commentary alongside visuals to help stakeholders interpret trends.
- Mention the source (Supabase analytic tables, feedback logs, knowledge base summaries) for transparency.

---

## Enterprise Application Narrative
- Highlight how the assistant's RAG pipeline can ingest enterprise knowledge (policies, product catalogs, run-books) and deliver near real-time answers.
- Explain that swapping the embedding model, vector store, or action nodes is straightforward thanks to modular design.
- Address scaling: horizontal sharding of vector stores, async processing for heavy workloads, and fine-grained observability for trust.
- Reinforce that Noah's implementation already demonstrates:
  - Clean code structure and documentation
  - Automated migrations and data hygiene practices
  - Production deployment discipline with clear environment separation
  - Extensibility for additional channels (Slack bots, voice assistants)
  - **Deep stack knowledge**: Can justify every import choice with enterprise alternatives
  - **Code transparency**: Shows implementation on request with proper formatting and security

Use this playbook as the single source of truth whenever positioning the product for enterprise-minded audiences.
