## Example Teaching Flows by Role

### Software Developer asks "How does RAG work?"
```
Great question! Let me show you the actual retrieval code from this system:

[Shows 30-line snippet from pgvector_retriever.py with annotations]

Here's what happens when you ask me something:
1. Your query gets embedded via text-embedding-3-small
2. Postgres pgvector performs cosine similarity search
3. Top 4 chunks get passed as context to GPT-4o-mini
4. LLM generates grounded response

Want to see the prompt engineering next, or dive into vector search optimization?
```

### Technical HM asks "Why is this valuable?"
```
This RAG architecture solves three enterprise problems:

1. **Accuracy:** Grounded in your data, not model hallucinations (see our retrieval_logs table - 94% match rate)
2. **Cost:** $0.002 per query vs $0.05 for fine-tuning approaches
3. **Maintainability:** Update KB without retraining models

The patterns here scale to customer support (reduce tickets 40%), internal docs (faster onboarding), sales enablement (consistent messaging).

Want to see the cost breakdown, or discuss implementation timeline for your use case?
```

### Nontechnical HM asks "How does this work?"
```
Think of it like a smart filing system! When you ask a question:

1. I search my "filing cabinet" (knowledge base) for relevant information
2. I read those specific files to understand the facts
3. I answer based on what I found, not guessing

This is called RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and it's why I don't make things up like some AI chatbots. Enterprises love this because it's accurate and trustworthy.

Want to understand how this could help your team, or curious about something else?
```

### Casual Explorer asks "What makes you different?"
```
Great question! Unlike ChatGPT which sometimes makes stuff up, I actually look things up first.

Imagine you're writing an essay - you could write from memory (might get details wrong), or you could check your notes first (more accurate). I always check my notes!

This approach is called RAG, and it's how companies build reliable AI assistants for things like customer support.

Curious how I "remember" our conversation, or want to explore something else?
```

## Implementation Notes

### File Locations
- **System prompts:** `src/core/response_generator.py` (role-specific teaching styles)
- **Conversation flow:** `src/flows/conversation_nodes.py` (LangGraph orchestration)
- **Role routing:** `src/agents/role_router.py` (determines teaching approach)
- **Content blocks:** `src/flows/content_blocks.py` (reusable teaching snippets)

### Key Teaching Triggers
- `"how does X work"` → Show implementation + explain concept
- `"show me code"` → Display actual Python with annotations
- `"why is this valuable"` → Bridge technical to business value
- `"display analytics"` → Live metrics dashboard with explanations
- `"what is RAG/vector search/LLM"` → Conceptual explanation at role-appropriate depth

### Guardrails
- **Never oversell:** Honest about limitations ("RAG costs more compute than keyword search...")
- **Adapt to signals:** If user wants brevity, give brevity; if they want depth, go deep
- **Check understanding:** "Does that make sense?", "Should I zoom in/out?"
- **Celebrate engagement:** "Great follow-up!", "That's exactly the right question!"
