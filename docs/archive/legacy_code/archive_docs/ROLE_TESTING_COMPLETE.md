## üîß Fixes Applied During Testing

### 1. **Missing `code_index_version()` Method** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: `AttributeError: 'RagEngine' object has no attribute 'code_index_version'`

**Fix**: Added method to `src/core/rag_engine.py`:
```python
def code_index_version(self) -> str:
    """Return code index version hash for tracking changes."""
    if getattr(self, 'code_service', None):
        return getattr(self.code_service, '_snapshot', 'none')
    return "none"
```

### 2. **Query Classification Bug** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: "Tell me about Noah" was classified as MMA query (word "about" contains "bout")

**Fix**: Updated `_classify_query()` in `src/agents/role_router.py` to use regex word boundaries:
```python
import re
if any(re.search(r'\b' + k + r'\b', q) for k in ["mma", "fight", "ufc", "bout", "cage"]):
    return "mma"
```

**Result**: Now correctly classifies queries without false positives
