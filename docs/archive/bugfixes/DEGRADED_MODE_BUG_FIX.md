# üêõ "[DEGRADED MODE SYNTHESIS]" Bug - Debug Summary

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED & FIXED**

---

## üîç Bug Description

User reported the app displaying:
```
[DEGRADED MODE SYNTHESIS]
see Noah's LinkedIn? A: You can view Noah's LinkedIn profile here: https://...
User question: what is noah's professional background? Please provide a 
helpful and accurate answer based on the information provided...
```

Instead of showing an actual AI-generated response, the system was leaking the raw prompt template.

## ‚úÖ Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: **Dependency Conflicts**

The bug was caused by **incompatible package versions** preventing Supabase from initializing properly:

1. **Pydantic v1 vs v2 conflict**
   - `realtime` package (part of Supabase) requires Pydantic v2
   - System had Pydantic v1.10.24 installed
   - Import error: `cannot import name 'with_config' from 'pydantic'`

2. **OpenAI version conflict**
   - `langchain-openai` requires `openai<2.0.0`
   - System had `openai 2.2.0` installed
   - Caused compatibility issues with LangChain

3. **httpx version conflicts**
   - Multiple packages requiring different httpx versions
   - `postgrest-py` wants `<0.24.0`
   - `supabase` wants `>=0.26`

### Impact Chain

## üîß Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Pydantic Version
```bash
pip install --upgrade pydantic>=2.0
```

**Before**: `pydantic==1.10.24`  
**After**: `pydantic==2.12.0`

### 2. Downgraded OpenAI
```bash
pip install "openai<2.0.0"
```

**Before**: `openai==2.2.0`  
**After**: `openai==1.57.4` (compatible with langchain-openai)

### 3. Reinstalled Supabase Stack
```bash
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall supabase
```

This ensured all Supabase components (realtime, storage3, supabase-auth, etc.) are compatible.

## ‚úÖ Verification Tests

### Test 1: OpenAI API Connection ‚úÖ
```
Testing embedding generation...
‚úÖ Embedding API works! Dimension: 1536

Testing chat completion...
‚úÖ Chat API works! Response: API working
```

### Test 2: Career KB Retrieval ‚úÖ
```
‚úÖ Found 20 career_kb chunks

Sample chunks:
  1. Walk me through your career so far...
  2. Why did you transition from Tesla Sales to Tech/AI projects?...
  3. What's the biggest project you've worked on?...

Testing vector search with career query...
‚úÖ Retrieved 3 chunks

  2. Similarity: 0.614 - What role does Noah usually play in a team project...
  3. Similarity: 0.614 - Where can I see Noah's LinkedIn?...
```

### Test 3: Response Generation ‚úÖ
```
Query: what is noah's professional background?
Role: Hiring Manager (nontechnical)

üìã Response Preview:
‚úÖ Response looks good!

## üéØ Next Steps (Error Handling Enhancement)

### Recommendation: Add Graceful Degradation

Currently, when errors occur, the system might show raw prompts. We should add better error handling:

#### 1. Add Try-Catch in Response Generator

```python
# src/core/response_generator.py

def generate_response(self, query: str, context: List[Dict], role: str) -> str:
    try:
        # Existing generation logic
        response = self.llm.predict(prompt)
        return response
    
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"LLM generation failed: {e}")
        
        # Return user-friendly error instead of raw prompt
        return (
            "I apologize, but I'm having trouble generating a response right now. "
            "This could be due to:\n"
            "- API rate limits\n"
            "- Network connectivity issues\n"
            "- Service unavailability\n\n"
            "Please try again in a moment. If the issue persists, "
            "please contact support."
        )
```

#### 2. Add Health Check Before Query Processing

```python
# src/main.py - Before processing user input

def check_system_health():
    """Verify all services are available"""
    health = {
        "openai": False,
        "supabase": False,
        "retrieval": False
    }
    
    try:
        # Test OpenAI
        openai_client.embeddings.create(
            model="text-embedding-3-small",
            input="test"
        )
        health["openai"] = True
    except:
        pass
    
    try:
        # Test Supabase
        supabase.table('kb_chunks').select('id').limit(1).execute()
        health["supabase"] = True
    except:
        pass
    
    return health

# In main chat loop:
if user_input:
    health = check_system_health()
    if not all(health.values()):
        st.error("‚ö†Ô∏è System health check failed. Some services are unavailable.")
        st.json(health)
        return
```

#### 3. Add Fallback Responses

```python
# src/agents/role_router.py

FALLBACK_RESPONSES = {
    "career": (
        "I'd love to tell you about Noah's background! "
        "You can find detailed information on his LinkedIn: "
        "[Noah's Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-de-la-calzada-25041235/)"
    ),
    "technical": (
        "For technical details about this project, please check the GitHub repository: "
        "[NoahsAIAssistant](https://github.com/iNoahCodeGuy/NoahsAIAssistant-)"
    ),
    "general": (
        "I'm having trouble accessing information right now. "
        "Please try rephrasing your question or visit Noah's LinkedIn profile."
    )
}

def _handle_error(self, query_type: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Return friendly fallback when generation fails"""
    return {
        "response": FALLBACK_RESPONSES.get(query_type, FALLBACK_RESPONSES["general"]),
        "type": "error",
        "context": []
    }
```

## üìã Lessons Learned

### 1. Dependency Management is Critical
- Python dependency conflicts can cause silent failures
- Always pin compatible versions in requirements.txt
- Use `pip list` to verify installed versions match requirements

### 2. Better Error Messages
- "DEGRADED MODE SYNTHESIS" is confusing for users
- Should show user-friendly error messages
- Log technical details but display simple explanations

### 3. Health Checks Are Important
- Add startup health check to verify all services
- Show status in UI (like the System Health panel)
- Fail fast with clear error messages

### 4. Test All Components Independently
- OpenAI API test
- Supabase connection test
- Retrieval test
- End-to-end test

### 5. Version Lock Critical Dependencies
```txt
# requirements.txt - Recommended versions
openai>=1.40,<2.0.0  # LangChain compatibility
pydantic>=2.0,<3.0   # Supabase realtime compatibility
supabase>=2.20.0     # Latest stable
langchain-openai>=0.3.0
```

## üí° Prevention Strategy

1. **Add CI/CD Checks**
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/test.yml
   - name: Install dependencies
     run: pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   - name: Run health checks
     run: python debug_degraded_mode.py
   ```

2. **Add Pre-commit Hook**
   ```bash
   # .git/hooks/pre-commit
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Running dependency check..."
   pip check || exit 1
   ```

3. **Document Known Issues**
   ```md
   # KNOWN_ISSUES.md
   ## Pydantic v1 vs v2
   - Supabase requires Pydantic v2
   - Some old packages may require v1
   - Solution: Always use Pydantic >=2.0
   ```
