# Display Intelligence Implementation

> **Portfolia now understands WHEN to provide longer responses, WHEN to show code, and WHEN to display data.**

## Overview

This enhancement aligns Portfolia's response behavior with the master documentation rules from `DATA_COLLECTION_AND_SCHEMA_REFERENCE.md` and `CONVERSATION_PERSONALITY.md`. The system now intelligently detects query intent and adjusts response length, code inclusion, and data formatting accordingly.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Query Classification Enhancements (`src/flows/query_classification.py`)

**Added Detection For:**

#### A. Teaching Moments / Longer Responses Needed
```python
teaching_keywords = [
    "why", "how does", "how did", "how do", "explain", "walk me through",
    "what is", "what are", "what's the difference", "compare",
    "help me understand", "break down", "teach me", "show me how",
    "architecture", "design", "pattern", "principle", "strategy",
    "trade-off", "tradeoff", "benefit", "advantage", "disadvantage",
    "when to use", "when should", "best practice", "enterprise"
]
```

**Sets flags:**
- `needs_longer_response`: True
- `teaching_moment`: True

**When detected:** User asks "why" or "how" questions, requests explanations, or wants to understand concepts/tradeoffs

---

#### B. Code Display Requests
```python
code_display_keywords = [
    "show code", "display code", "show me code", "show the code",
    "show implementation", "display implementation",
    "how do you", "how does it", "how is it",
    "show me the", "show retrieval", "show api",
    "code snippet", "code example", "source code"
]
```

**Sets flags:**
- `code_display_requested`: True
- `query_type`: "technical"

**When detected:** User explicitly asks to see code or implementation details

---

#### C. Data/Analytics Display Requests
```python
# Already existed via _is_data_display_request()
```

**Sets flags:**
- `data_display_requested`: True
- `query_type`: "data"

**When detected:** User asks for "show analytics", "display data", "metrics", "performance stats"

---

### 2. Response Generation Intelligence (`src/flows/core_nodes.py`)

**Modified `generate_answer()` to add display guidance:**

```python
# Build extra_instructions based on query classification
extra_instructions = []

# When teaching/explaining, provide comprehensive depth
if state.fetch("needs_longer_response", False) or state.fetch("teaching_moment", False):
    extra_instructions.append(
        "This is a teaching moment - provide a comprehensive, well-structured explanation. "
        "Break down concepts clearly, connect technical details to business value, and "
        "help the user truly understand. Use examples where helpful."
    )

# When code is requested, technical users want implementation details
if state.fetch("code_display_requested", False) and state.role in [
    "Software Developer", 
    "Hiring Manager (technical)"
]:
    extra_instructions.append(
        "The user has requested code. After your explanation, include relevant code snippets "
        "with comments explaining key decisions. Keep code blocks under 40 lines and focus "
        "on the most interesting parts."
    )

# When data is requested, be concise and table-focused
if state.fetch("data_display_requested", False):
    extra_instructions.append(
        "The user wants data/analytics. Be brief with narrative - focus on presenting clean "
        "tables with proper formatting. Include source attribution."
    )
```

These instructions are passed to the LLM via the `extra_instructions` parameter.

---

### 3. LLM Prompt Enhancement (`src/core/response_generator.py`)

**Updated `generate_contextual_response()` signature:**
```python
def generate_contextual_response(
    self, 
    query: str, 
    context: List[Dict[str, Any]], 
    role: str = None, 
    chat_history: List[Dict[str, str]] = None,
    extra_instructions: str = None  # NEW PARAMETER
) -> str:
```

**Updated `_build_role_prompt()` to inject instructions:**
```python
def _build_role_prompt(
    self, 
    query: str, 
    context_str: str, 
    role: str = None, 
    chat_history: List[Dict[str, str]] = None,
    extra_instructions: str = None  # NEW PARAMETER
) -> str:
    # ...
    instruction_addendum = ""
    if extra_instructions:
        instruction_addendum = f"\n\nIMPORTANT GUIDANCE: {extra_instructions}\n"
    
    # Then inject {instruction_addendum} into each role's prompt template
```

**Injected in all role prompts:**
- Hiring Manager (technical)
- Software Developer  
- General (Just looking around, etc.)

## Behavior Matrix

| Query Type | Flags Set | Response Style | Example Query |
|------------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Teaching/Why** | `needs_longer_response`, `teaching_moment` | Comprehensive, well-structured explanation with examples | "Why use pgvector instead of FAISS?" |
| **Code Request** | `code_display_requested`, `query_type=technical` | Explanation + code snippets (≤40 lines) with comments | "Show me the retrieval code" |
| **Data Request** | `data_display_requested`, `query_type=data` | Brief narrative + clean tables with source attribution | "Display analytics for last 7 days" |
| **General** | None | Standard conversational response | "Tell me about Noah's experience" |

---

## Alignment with Master Documentation

### From `DATA_COLLECTION_AND_SCHEMA_REFERENCE.md`:

> **Reasoning heuristics (what to show and when)**
> - If the question is **how/why** → long narrative with diagrams/code if needed.  
> - If the question is **show/metrics/analytics** → concise tables and charts with minimal prose.  
> - If user is technical and seems unsure → proactively show a small code snippet (≤40 lines) with comments.

✅ **IMPLEMENTED** via:
- Teaching keywords → `needs_longer_response` → "provide comprehensive explanation"
- Data keywords → `data_display_requested` → "be brief with narrative, focus on tables"
- Code keywords + technical role → `code_display_requested` → "include code snippets with comments"

---

### From `CONVERSATION_PERSONALITY.md`:

> **Core personality traits (The AI Applications Educator)**
> - Teaching-focused on GenAI systems
> - Enterprise value champion
> - Passionate about the craft
> - Adapt explanation depth to user

✅ **IMPLEMENTED** via:
- Teaching moments get "Break down concepts clearly, connect technical details to business value"
- Extra instructions respect role context (only show code to technical roles)
- LLM receives guidance to match user's level of detail expectations

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Scenarios:

1. **Teaching Query** (expects longer response):
   ```
   Role: Software Developer
   Query: "Why did you choose pgvector instead of FAISS for vector search?"
   Expected: Comprehensive explanation covering technical reasons, enterprise value, tradeoffs
   ```

2. **Code Display Query** (expects code + explanation):
   ```
   Role: Software Developer
   Query: "Show me how you implement the retrieval logic"
   Expected: Explanation followed by code snippet from pgvector_retriever.py with comments
   ```

3. **Data Query** (expects tables):
   ```
   Role: Hiring Manager (technical)
   Query: "Show me analytics for the last week"
   Expected: Brief intro + clean markdown table + source attribution
   ```

4. **General Query** (expects standard response):
   ```
   Role: Just looking around
   Query: "What's Noah's background?"
   Expected: Conversational summary of career history
   ```

### Automated Testing (Future):

Create `tests/test_display_intelligence.py`:
```python
def test_teaching_moment_detection():
    state = ConversationState(role="Software Developer", query="Why use RAG?")
    state = classify_query(state)
    assert state.fetch("needs_longer_response") == True
    assert state.fetch("teaching_moment") == True

def test_code_display_detection():
    state = ConversationState(role="Software Developer", query="Show me the code")
    state = classify_query(state)
    assert state.fetch("code_display_requested") == True
    assert state.fetch("query_type") == "technical"

def test_data_display_detection():
    state = ConversationState(role="Hiring Manager (technical)", query="Display analytics")
    state = classify_query(state)
    assert state.fetch("data_display_requested") == True
    assert state.fetch("query_type") == "data"
```

---

## Production Impact

### Performance:
- **No additional API calls** - instructions passed to existing LLM call
- **Minimal token overhead** - extra_instructions adds ~50-100 tokens per request
- **Cost impact**: Negligible (<$0.0001 per query increase)

### User Experience:
- **Better alignment** with user intent (teaching vs data vs code)
- **More focused responses** - no more verbose data responses or terse teaching moments
- **Role-aware** - technical users get code, business users get value explanations

### Deployment:
- **No schema changes** - pure logic enhancement
- **No breaking changes** - all existing functionality preserved
- **Gradual rollout** - can A/B test with `extra_instructions=None` fallback

---

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and deploy** this enhancement to production
2. **Monitor analytics** for:
   - Average response length by query type
   - Code snippet inclusion rate for technical roles
   - User satisfaction by query classification
3. **Iterate** based on feedback:
   - Add more teaching keywords if detection misses queries
   - Adjust code snippet length guidance (currently ≤40 lines)
   - Refine data table formatting instructions
