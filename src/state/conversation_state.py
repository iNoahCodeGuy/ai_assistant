"""ConversationState TypedDict for LangGraph nodes.

This module defines the state structure passed between LangGraph nodes in the
conversation pipeline. Uses TypedDict with total=False to allow partial state
updates while maintaining type safety.

Design Principles Applied:
- Loose Coupling: Nodes communicate only via this state dict
- Simplicity (YAGNI): No StateHelper class - Python's dict methods are sufficient
- Maintainability: Clear type hints for all fields
- Portability: Works across all LangGraph-compatible environments

Architecture:
    LangGraph nodes receive ConversationState as input and return Dict[str, Any]
    containing partial updates. LangGraph automatically merges these updates into
    the full state before passing to the next node.

Example Usage:
    ```python
    from src.state.conversation_state import ConversationState
    from typing import Dict, Any

    def classify_query(state: ConversationState) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        \"\"\"Classify user query type.\"\"\"
        query = state["query"]  # Direct access for required fields
        role = state.get("role", "Developer")  # .get() for optional fields

        query_type = _determine_type(query, role)
        return {"query_type": query_type}  # Partial update
    ```

    Uses total=False to allow partial state updates from nodes. Each node
    returns a Dict[str, Any] containing only the fields it modifies, and
    LangGraph merges these updates into the full state.

    Design Rationale:
        - total=False: Allows nodes to return partial updates (Principle: Modularity)
        - Annotated[list, add_messages]: LangGraph auto-appends chat messages (Principle: DRY)
