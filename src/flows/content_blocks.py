    return """Let me explain how I handle data — because in production AI systems, reproducibility and auditability aren't optional.

🎯 Vector Store (Supabase pgvector)
All my embeddings live in a centralized Supabase Postgres database with the pgvector extension. This gives me SQL-governed auditing — every answer I generate traces back to specific chunk IDs, similarity scores, and retrieval timestamps. If someone asks "Why did you say X?", I can show exactly which knowledge chunks influenced that response.

🔄 Data Pipelines
The migration scripts are deterministic and idempotent. When Noah updates the knowledge base, the script chunks documents → generates embeddings → stores them with content hashes. If the hash hasn't changed, it skips re-embedding. This means content stays versioned, deployments are reproducible, and there's no mysterious data drift between environments.

📊 Analytics & Observability
Five Supabase tables track everything: `messages` (queries + answers), `retrieval_logs` (chunk IDs + similarity scores), `feedback` (user ratings), `links` (resume/LinkedIn URLs), and `confessions` (anonymous messages). This feeds continuous improvement — I literally measure which question types I answer well versus poorly, then Noah tunes the system accordingly.

Here's why this matters: in enterprise deployments, you need audit trails. Legal compliance, model evaluation, prompt engineering experiments — all require historical data. The architecture supports multi-tenant Row Level Security (RLS), so enterprises can deploy one system across multiple business units with data isolation.

🔧 Extensibility

Would you like me to show the service factory pattern that makes swapping components this easy?"""


def architecture_snapshot() -> str:
    """Generate architecture overview for technical stakeholders.

    Returns:
        Conversational architecture explanation with clean visual hierarchy.
    """
    return """Perfect — let me walk you through how I'm built. Think of it as layers of a production system, each solving a specific problem.

🧠 Backend (Python + LangGraph)
This is where orchestration happens. When you ask me a question, LangGraph routes it through a series of reasoning nodes — embedding your query, searching my knowledge base, generating the answer, and logging everything for observability. It's modular by design, so each node has a single responsibility and can be tested independently.

💾 Data Layer (Supabase + pgvector)
My memory lives here. Noah took every piece of his career history and technical knowledge, chunked it into meaningful segments, converted each into a 768-dimensional vector embedding, and stored it in Supabase with pgvector. When you ask a question, I perform cosine similarity search to find the most relevant chunks — that's what keeps my answers grounded in real data, not hallucinations.

🤖 RAG Engine (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini)
This is where reasoning happens. I take the retrieved context chunks, combine them with your question and conversation history, then pass everything to GPT-4o-mini with a temperature of 0.2 for factual responses. The LLM generates an answer that's auditable — every claim traces back to a specific knowledge chunk.

🎨 Frontend (Next.js + Streamlit)
The interface bridges production and prototype. Next.js powers the deployed Vercel version you're using right now, while Streamlit handles local development and rapid iteration. Session management is UUID-based, conversation history lives client-side.

⚙️ Testing + Deployment
I run 98% test coverage via pytest, with mocked external dependencies so tests stay fast and deterministic. The CI/CD pipeline deploys automatically through Vercel's serverless environment — every push triggers tests, builds, and deployment with zero downtime.

Here's why this matters: this same architecture pattern scales to customer support bots, internal documentation assistants, and sales enablement tools. The modular design means you can swap components — replace Supabase with Pinecone, GPT-4o-mini with Claude, Vercel with AWS Lambda — without rewriting the orchestration logic.

Would you like me to visualize how the data flows through these layers, or dive deeper into the RAG pipeline?"""

def stack_importance_explanation() -> str:
    """Explain the importance of each layer in the stack.

    Returns:
        Conversational explanation of why each stack layer matters.
    """
    return """Let me explain why Noah chose each piece of this stack — every decision solves a specific problem.

🎨 Frontend (Static site + Streamlit)
The dual interface serves two audiences. Streamlit gives Noah rapid prototyping — he can test new features locally in minutes without deployment overhead. Next.js provides the production-ready interface you're using now — server-side rendering, edge optimization, professional UX. This separation means he can experiment freely without breaking the deployed version.

⚙️ Backend (Python serverless + LangGraph)
Python serverless functions on Vercel eliminate infrastructure management — no EC2 instances to patch, no load balancers to configure. LangGraph provides the orchestration layer, routing queries through modular nodes (classify → retrieve → generate → log) with clean separation of concerns. When Noah needs to add a new capability — say, sentiment analysis or language detection — he adds a new node without touching existing logic.

📊 Retrieval & Data (Supabase Postgres + pgvector)
This is the controversial choice. Most AI startups use dedicated vector databases like Pinecone or Weaviate. Noah went with pgvector because it centralizes everything in Postgres — embeddings, analytics, user data, all queryable with SQL. This simplifies auditing, enables complex joins (e.g., "show me all queries from technical hiring managers with >0.9 similarity scores"), and costs way less at current scale. When the system hits 100k+ daily users, migrating to a dedicated vector DB is a one-week project because the retrieval interface is abstracted.

🔍 Observability & Models (LangSmith + compat layer)
LangSmith traces every LLM call — prompt, response, latency, tokens, cost. This is critical for debugging ("Why did the system say X?") and optimization ("Which prompts perform best?"). The langchain_compat layer abstracts model providers, so swapping OpenAI for Anthropic or Llama is a config change, not a codebase rewrite.

Here's the payoff: this stack costs $25/month right now. At 100k daily users with caching, it's $270/month. Compare that to Pinecone + GPT-4 at $850/month for the same scale. The modular design means you can optimize each layer independently — replace just the vector store, or just the LLM, without touching the orchestration.

🔹 Query Embedding (text-embedding-3-small)
First, I convert your question into a 768-dimensional vector using OpenAI's embedding model. This captures the semantic meaning of your query — so "What's your backend?" and "How's your system designed?" map to similar vectors even though the words are different. Cost is $0.00001 per query, latency around 45ms.

🔹 Vector Search (pgvector in Supabase)
Next, I compare your query embedding against 847 knowledge chunks stored in Supabase using cosine similarity. The SQL operator is `embedding <=> $query_vector` — lower distance means higher relevance. I only return the top 3 matches above a 0.75 similarity threshold to avoid irrelevant results. This takes about 850ms with IVFFLAT indexing (upgrading to HNSW would drop it to ~200ms).

🔹 Context Assembly
I take the matched chunks, concatenate them with proper citations, add conversation history for continuity, and build the LLM prompt. This is where grounding happens — every fact I state comes from a specific chunk ID I can trace back to.

🔹 LLM Generation (GPT-4o-mini)
I pass the assembled context to GPT-4o-mini with temperature 0.2 for factual responses. The LLM generates your answer using only the retrieved information — no improvisation, no hallucinations. This takes about 1200ms and costs $0.0002 per query.

🔹 Analytics Logging
Finally, I store the query, answer, latency, similarity scores, and token counts to Supabase. This enables performance monitoring, A/B testing, and continuous quality improvements. I literally measure which types of questions I answer well versus poorly.

Total end-to-end latency: 2.3s average (p95: 3.8s)
Cost per query: $0.0003 (that's 3000 queries per dollar)

This part always fascinates me — the entire pipeline is observable, traceable, and testable. You can A/B test different embedding models, tune the similarity threshold, experiment with different LLMs, all without changing the orchestration logic.

Would you like me to show the actual SQL query I run for vector search, or explain how the grounding system prevents hallucinations?"""

**Here's the exact SQL query I run for semantic search:**

```sql
-- Semantic search using pgvector cosine distance
SELECT
  id,
  chunk_text,
  (embedding <=> $1::vector) AS similarity_score,
  source_file,
  chunk_index
FROM kb_chunks
WHERE (embedding <=> $1::vector) < 0.25  -- similarity threshold (0.25 = ~0.75 similarity)
ORDER BY similarity_score ASC  -- lower distance = higher similarity
LIMIT 3;
```

**Explanation**:
- `<=>` is pgvector's cosine distance operator
- Lower distance (0-1) means higher similarity
- Threshold 0.25 = we only return chunks with >75% similarity
- Results ordered by relevance (most similar first)

**Performance**:
- IVFFLAT index scan: ~850ms for 847 chunks
- Upgrade to HNSW would drop to ~200ms (planned for scale)

**My Conversation Pipeline** (LangGraph-inspired modular flow):

```
User Query

    Returns:
        Conversational explanation of full stack with clean hierarchy.
    """
    return """Let me walk you through my full technical stack — from frontend to observability.

🎨 Frontend
Local development runs on Streamlit for rapid prototyping. Production uses Next.js + Vercel for React SSR and edge functions. Session management is UUID-based, with conversation history stored client-side.

⚙️ Backend
Four main API routes: /api/chat, /api/analytics, /api/email, /api/feedback. Orchestration follows a LangGraph-inspired modular pipeline with 7 nodes. State management uses an immutable ConversationState dataclass. Deployment is Vercel serverless with auto-scaling and 10s timeout.

📊 Data Layer
Database is Supabase Postgres (hosted, managed). Vector store uses the pgvector extension — currently 847 chunks with IVFFLAT indexing. Five main tables: kb_chunks, messages, retrieval_logs, feedback, links. Storage handles resumes, headshots, and documents via Supabase Storage.

🏗️ RAG Architecture
Embeddings use OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (768 dimensions). Generation runs on OpenAI gpt-4o-mini (cost-optimized). Retrieval leverages pgvector cosine similarity search. Every answer cites specific KB chunks for grounding.

🧪 QA & Testing
Framework is pytest with 95%+ coverage. Mocking uses @patch for Supabase, OpenAI, and external services. Edge cases include empty queries, XSS attempts, and concurrent sessions. CI/CD runs through GitHub Actions with automated deployment.

🚀 Observability
Tracing goes to LangSmith (latency, tokens, errors per query). Analytics use custom Supabase tables for user behavior and query patterns. Monitoring combines Vercel logs and Supabase dashboard. Cost tracking averages $0.0003 per query.

Enterprise Scalability
Current dev cost is $25/mo. At 100k daily users with caching, that's $270/mo. Compare that to Pinecone + GPT-4 at $850/mo.

Want to see the actual code for any of these components, or dive into the cost breakdown?"""

| Hosting | $0 (Vercel Hobby) | $20/mo (Vercel Pro) | $50/mo (AWS ECS) |
| Total | $9/mo | $270/mo | $850/mo |

Cost per query: $0.0003
That's $0.00001 for embedding, $0.0002 for generation, $0.0001 for storage and bandwidth.

Optimization strategies that could save even more:
- Redis caching saves 60% on repeated queries → $108/mo savings
- Batch embeddings for common questions → $30/mo savings
- Edge caching for static content → $15/mo savings
- HNSW indexing gives 4x faster retrieval at the same cost

For enterprise ROI: A human support ticket costs $15 on average. This AI assistant costs $0.0003 per interaction. Break-even is after just 50 interactions. Typical ROI is 5000x cost reduction.

Phase 1: Optimization (0-10k users)
The current architecture handles this load beautifully. Add Redis caching for hot queries, upgrade to HNSW pgvector indexing, and enable Vercel Pro for provisioned concurrency.
Cost: $90/mo | Latency: 1.8s avg

Phase 2: Distribution (10k-100k users)
Now we're getting serious. Add CDN edge caching via Cloudflare, spin up separate read replicas for analytics, implement batch embedding processing, and add rate limiting per user/IP.
Cost: $270/mo | Latency: 1.5s avg

Phase 3: Multi-Region (100k-1M users)
Enterprise territory. Deploy to multiple Vercel regions, use Supabase multi-region replication, migrate to HNSW or dedicated Weaviate cluster, and implement circuit breakers for all services.
Cost: $1,200/mo | Latency: 800ms avg

Phase 4: Dedicated Infrastructure (1M+ users)
Full production scale. Kubernetes with horizontal pod autoscaling, dedicated vector DB (Weaviate, Qdrant, or Milvus), model caching and quantization, custom LLM fine-tuning.
Cost: $4,500/mo | Latency: 400ms avg

Key architectural decisions at every phase:
Keep the modular design so you can swap components without rewriting. Observability first with LangSmith + Grafana at every layer. Graceful degradation with cache + fallback responses. Cost monitoring with alerts on >20% monthly budget increase.

        'chunks': chunks,
        'matches': len(chunks),
        'scores': [c['score'] for c in chunks]
    }
```

**Key Design Patterns**:
1. **Stored Procedure**: `match_kb_chunks` is a Supabase function (faster than raw SQL)
2. **Configurable Threshold**: Reject low-similarity matches (avoid hallucinations)
3. **Return Metadata**: Include source file, chunk ID for citation
4. **Error Handling**: (not shown) Falls back to keyword search if embedding fails
