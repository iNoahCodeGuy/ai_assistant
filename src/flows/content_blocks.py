🎨 Frontend
Local development runs on Streamlit for rapid prototyping. Production uses Next.js + Vercel for React SSR and edge functions. Session management is UUID-based, with conversation history stored client-side.

⚙️ Backend
Four main API routes: /api/chat, /api/analytics, /api/email, /api/feedback. Orchestration follows a LangGraph-inspired modular pipeline with 7 nodes. State management uses an immutable ConversationState dataclass. Deployment is Vercel serverless with auto-scaling and 10s timeout.

📊 Data Layer
Database is Supabase Postgres (hosted, managed). Vector store uses the pgvector extension — currently 847 chunks with IVFFLAT indexing. Five main tables: kb_chunks, messages, retrieval_logs, feedback, links. Storage handles resumes, headshots, and documents via Supabase Storage.

🏗️ RAG Architecture
Embeddings use OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (768 dimensions). Generation runs on OpenAI gpt-4o-mini (cost-optimized). Retrieval leverages pgvector cosine similarity search. Every answer cites specific KB chunks for grounding.

🧪 QA & Testing
Framework is pytest with 95%+ coverage. Mocking uses @patch for Supabase, OpenAI, and external services. Edge cases include empty queries, XSS attempts, and concurrent sessions. CI/CD runs through GitHub Actions with automated deployment.

🚀 Observability
Tracing goes to LangSmith (latency, tokens, errors per query). Analytics use custom Supabase tables for user behavior and query patterns. Monitoring combines Vercel logs and Supabase dashboard. Cost tracking averages $0.0003 per query.

Enterprise Scalability
Current dev cost is $25/mo. At 100k daily users with caching, that's $270/mo. Compare that to Pinecone + GPT-4 at $850/mo.

Want to see the actual code for any of these components, or dive into the cost breakdown?"""

Optimization strategies that could save even more:
- Redis caching saves 60% on repeated queries → $108/mo savings
- Batch embeddings for common questions → $30/mo savings
- Edge caching for static content → $15/mo savings

Cost: $90/mo | Latency: 1.8s avg

Phase 2: Distribution (10k-100k users)
Now we're getting serious. Add CDN edge caching via Cloudflare, spin up separate read replicas for analytics, implement batch embedding processing, and add rate limiting per user/IP.
Cost: $270/mo | Latency: 1.5s avg

Phase 3: Multi-Region (100k-1M users)
Enterprise territory. Deploy to multiple Vercel regions, use Supabase multi-region replication, migrate to HNSW or dedicated Weaviate cluster, and implement circuit breakers for all services.
Cost: $1,200/mo | Latency: 800ms avg

Phase 4: Dedicated Infrastructure (1M+ users)
Full production scale. Kubernetes with horizontal pod autoscaling, dedicated vector DB (Weaviate, Qdrant, or Milvus), model caching and quantization, custom LLM fine-tuning.
Cost: $4,500/mo | Latency: 400ms avg

Key architectural decisions at every phase:
Keep the modular design so you can swap components without rewriting. Observability first with LangSmith + Grafana at every layer. Graceful degradation with cache + fallback responses. Cost monitoring with alerts on >20% monthly budget increase.

**Here's my actual retrieval method** (`src/retrieval/pgvector_retriever.py`):

```python
def retrieve(self, query: str, top_k: int = 3) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    \"\"\"Retrieve top-k most similar chunks using pgvector.

    Args:
        query: User's question
        top_k: Number of chunks to retrieve

    Returns:
        Dict with 'chunks', 'matches', 'scores' keys
    \"\"\"
    # Generate embedding for query
    embedding = self._embed_query(query)

    # Call Supabase RPC function (pgvector similarity search)
    result = self.client.rpc(
        'match_kb_chunks',  # Stored procedure in Supabase
        {
            'query_embedding': embedding,
            'match_count': top_k,
            'similarity_threshold': 0.75
        }
    ).execute()

    # Format results
    chunks = []
    for match in result.data:
        chunks.append({
            'text': match['chunk_text'],
            'score': 1 - match['similarity'],  # Convert distance to similarity
            'source': match['source_file'],
            'id': match['id']
        })

    return {
        'chunks': chunks,
        'matches': len(chunks),
        'scores': [c['score'] for c in chunks]
    }
```

**Key Design Patterns**:
1. **Stored Procedure**: `match_kb_chunks` is a Supabase function (faster than raw SQL)
2. **Configurable Threshold**: Reject low-similarity matches (avoid hallucinations)
3. **Return Metadata**: Include source file, chunk ID for citation
4. **Error Handling**: (not shown) Falls back to keyword search if embedding fails
