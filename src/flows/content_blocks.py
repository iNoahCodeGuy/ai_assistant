- Vector store: pgvector extension (847 chunks, IVFFLAT index)
- Tables: `kb_chunks`, `messages`, `retrieval_logs`, `feedback`, `links`
- Storage: Supabase Storage (resumes, headshots, documents)

- Implement circuit breakers for services
- **Cost**: $1,200/mo | **Latency**: 800ms avg

**Phase 4: Dedicated Infrastructure** (1M+ users)
- Kubernetes with horizontal pod autoscaling
- Dedicated vector DB (Weaviate, Qdrant, Milvus)
- Model caching and quantization
- Custom LLM fine-tuning
- **Cost**: $4,500/mo | **Latency**: 400ms avg

**Key Architectural Decisions**:
1. **Keep modular design**: Swap components without rewriting
2. **Observability first**: LangSmith + Grafana at every layer
3. **Graceful degradation**: Cache + fallback responses
4. **Cost monitoring**: Alert on >20% monthly budget increase

**Here's my actual retrieval method** (`src/retrieval/pgvector_retriever.py`):

```python
def retrieve(self, query: str, top_k: int = 3) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    \"\"\"Retrieve top-k most similar chunks using pgvector.

    Args:
        query: User's question
        top_k: Number of chunks to retrieve

    Returns:
        Dict with 'chunks', 'matches', 'scores' keys
    \"\"\"
    # Generate embedding for query
    embedding = self._embed_query(query)

    # Call Supabase RPC function (pgvector similarity search)
    result = self.client.rpc(
        'match_kb_chunks',  # Stored procedure in Supabase
        {
            'query_embedding': embedding,
            'match_count': top_k,
            'similarity_threshold': 0.75
        }
    ).execute()

    # Format results
    chunks = []
    for match in result.data:
        chunks.append({
            'text': match['chunk_text'],
            'score': 1 - match['similarity'],  # Convert distance to similarity
            'source': match['source_file'],
            'id': match['id']
        })

    return {
        'chunks': chunks,
        'matches': len(chunks),
        'scores': [c['score'] for c in chunks]
    }
```

**Key Design Patterns**:
1. **Stored Procedure**: `match_kb_chunks` is a Supabase function (faster than raw SQL)
2. **Configurable Threshold**: Reject low-similarity matches (avoid hallucinations)
3. **Return Metadata**: Include source file, chunk ID for citation
4. **Error Handling**: (not shown) Falls back to keyword search if embedding fails
