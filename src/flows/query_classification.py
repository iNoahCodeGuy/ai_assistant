"""Query classification utilities.

This module detects what kind of question the user is asking so we can
route it appropriately and plan the right follow-up actions.

Types we detect:
- Technical queries (architecture, code, stack questions)
- Career queries (resume, experience, achievements)
- Data display requests (show analytics, metrics)
- MMA queries (Noah's fight history)
- Fun queries (hobbies, fun facts)

Vague query expansion:
- Detects single-word or very short queries that need context enrichment
- Expands them into fuller questions to improve retrieval quality
