"""Presentation control nodes for Portfolia's teach-first experience.

These nodes sit between intent classification and retrieval to decide how much
structure and which supporting artifacts should be presented. They do not
invoke the LLM. Instead, they annotate the ConversationState with presentation
metadata used later by format_answer.

Exports:
    depth_controller(state) -> ConversationState
        Chooses depth level (1-3) based on role, intent, turn count, and
        teaching signals.

    display_controller(state) -> ConversationState
        Decides whether to surface code, data/metrics, or diagrams based on
        heuristics plus the selected depth level.
