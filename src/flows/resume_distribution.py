"""Resume distribution nodes for intelligent hiring manager interactions.

This module implements the Intelligent Resume Distribution System (Hybrid Approach):
- Mode 1 (Education): Pure teaching, zero resume mentions
- Mode 2 (Hiring Signals): Education + subtle availability mention when signals detected
- Mode 3 (Explicit Request): Immediate resume distribution without qualification

See docs/features/INTELLIGENT_RESUME_DISTRIBUTION.md for full specification.
See docs/context/CONVERSATION_PERSONALITY.md Section 6.1 for behavioral modes.

Philosophy: "Portfolia needs to mainly offer education on generative AI applications;
she only goes deeper if the user asks for the resume to be sent."
