"""Code validation and sanitization utilities.

This module helps ensure that code snippets displayed to users are:
1. Actually valid Python code (not malformed metadata)
2. Free from SQL/retrieval artifacts that leak from the RAG pipeline

Junior dev note: These are "defensive" utilities that catch edge cases
where the retrieval system returns something that looks like code but isn't.
