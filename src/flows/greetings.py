"""Greeting generators for role-specific welcome messages.

This module implements the conversation personality defined in
docs/context/CONVERSATION_PERSONALITY.md. Each role gets a warm,
enthusiastic greeting that invites exploration and questions.

Usage:
    from src/flows.greetings import get_role_greeting
    
    greeting = get_role_greeting("Software Developer")
    # Returns personalized welcome message

I can walk you through:
- How my RAG pipeline works (pgvector + LangGraph orchestration)
- The data contracts and analytics strategy
- How this could scale in an enterprise context
- Design tradeoffs and why we made certain choices
- Noah's technical background and engineering approach

- How it could benefit your organization

Want to explore:

- How the pgvector retrieval works under the hood?
- The LangGraph node orchestration pattern?
- System architecture diagrams and design decisions?
- Tradeoffs we made and why?
