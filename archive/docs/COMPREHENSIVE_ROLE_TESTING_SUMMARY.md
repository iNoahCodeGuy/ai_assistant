## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### Bug 1: Missing `code_index_version()` Method
**Error**:
```
AttributeError: 'RagEngine' object has no attribute 'code_index_version'
```

**Root Cause**: Method was called in `retrieve_with_code()` but not defined

**Fix**: Added method to `src/core/rag_engine.py`:
```python
def code_index_version(self) -> str:
    """Return code index version hash for tracking changes."""
    if getattr(self, 'code_service', None):
        return getattr(self.code_service, '_snapshot', 'none')
    return "none"
```

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested

---

### Bug 2: Query Classification False Positive
**Problem**: Query "Tell me about Noah" was classified as MMA query

**Root Cause**: Word "about" contains substring "bout", which triggered MMA classification

**Before**:
```python
if any(k in q for k in ["mma", "fight", "ufc", "bout", "cage"]):
    return "mma"
```

**After**:
```python
import re
if any(re.search(r'\b' + k + r'\b', q) for k in ["mma", "fight", "ufc", "bout", "cage"]):
    return "mma"
```

**Result**: Now uses word boundaries to prevent false matches

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested

## 🧠 Chat Memory Implementation

All roles (except confession) support multi-turn conversations:

**How It Works**:
1. Last 4 messages (2 exchanges) maintained in `chat_history`
2. Context passed to `generate_response()` method
3. LLM receives conversation history in prompt
4. Follow-up questions reference previous context

**Example**:
```
User: "What programming languages does Noah know?"
AI: "Noah is proficient in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript..."

User: "Which of those has he used professionally?"
AI: "Based on his career history, Noah has used Python and
     TypeScript professionally at [companies]..."
```

**Status**: ✅ Working across all roles

---

## 🔍 Query Classification

Automatic detection based on keywords:

| Query Type | Keywords | Example |
|------------|----------|---------|
| **MMA** | mma, fight, ufc, bout (word boundaries), cage | "Does Noah do MMA?" |
| **Fun Facts** | fun fact, hobby, hobbies, interesting fact | "Tell me a fun fact" |
| **Technical** | code, technical, stack, function, architecture | "Show me the code" |
| **Career** | career, resume, cv, experience, achievement, work | "What's Noah's background?" |
| **General** | Everything else | "Tell me about Noah" |

**Status**: ✅ Word boundary regex prevents false positives

---

## 📈 Performance Metrics

From automated tests:

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Response Time | < 5s | ~2-3s | ✅ Pass |
| Retrieval Time | < 2s | ~0.5-1s | ✅ Pass |
| Similarity Scores | > 0.3 | 0.3-0.7 | ✅ Pass |
| Chat History | Last 4 msgs | Working | ✅ Pass |
