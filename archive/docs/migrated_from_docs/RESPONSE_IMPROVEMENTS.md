# Response Quality Improvements - October 7, 2025

## üéØ Issues Addressed

### 1. **"Notable Outcomes" Section Mystery** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Generic "Notable Outcomes (Derived from grounded data.)" appeared on every response, adding no value.

**Root Cause**: Hard-coded in `src/agents/response_formatter.py` line 110:
```python
return f"## Career Overview\n{response}\n\n### Notable Outcomes\n(Derived from grounded data.)\n\n### Sources\n{sources}"
```

**Solution**: Removed generic section, replaced with detailed source citations showing:
- Doc ID (career_kb, technical_kb, architecture_kb)
- Section/question title
- Similarity score (0.0-1.0)

**New Format**:
```markdown
{response}

---

### üìö Sources
1. **technical_kb** - What is the tech stack? (similarity: 0.89)
2. **architecture_kb** - Show me the system architecture diagram (similarity: 0.82)
3. **career_kb** - What projects has Noah worked on? (similarity: 0.76)
```

---

### 2. **Code & Diagrams Not Displaying** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: User asked "can you display or reference code?" but got "I don't have enough information", even though we just added 7 architecture items with full code examples.

**Root Cause**: LLM was summarizing/paraphrasing code instead of displaying it verbatim.

**Solution**: Enhanced system prompts in `src/core/response_generator.py` to explicitly instruct:

```python
IMPORTANT: If the context contains code examples, diagrams, or technical documentation:
- Display them EXACTLY as provided (preserve all formatting, backticks, markdown)
- Keep Mermaid diagrams intact within ```mermaid``` blocks
- Keep code blocks intact within ``` code ``` blocks
- Keep ASCII diagrams with exact spacing and characters
- Do not summarize or paraphrase code/diagrams - show them in full
- Add brief explanations AFTER showing the code/diagram
```

**Applied to**:
- Hiring Manager (technical) prompts
- Software Developer prompts  
- General prompts

   - Dynamic parameter adjustment

6. **Database Schema**
   - ASCII ERD with all 5 tables
   - Foreign key relationships
   - Index details (IVFFLAT, B-tree)

7. **Data Flow Diagram**
   - 9-stage pipeline with latency breakdown
   - Cost per stage
   - Optimization opportunities

## üéØ Testing Instructions

### Test Queries to Try:

**For Software Developer Role:**
1. "Show me the system architecture"
   - Should display full Mermaid diagram
   - Should show component breakdown with file paths

2. "Show me the RAG retrieval code"
   - Should display complete Python class
   - Should display Postgres function
   - Should include performance analysis

3. "Can you display code?"
   - Should now say YES and show examples
   - Should reference the 7 architecture items available

4. "Show me the complete file structure"
   - Should display full project tree
   - Should show lines of code breakdown

5. "How does response generation work?"
   - Should display full Python implementation
   - Should show role-specific prompts

**For Hiring Manager Role:**
1. "Show me the system architecture"
   - Should display diagram with business context
   - Should explain scalability and cost efficiency

2. "What's the database architecture?"
   - Should display schema diagram
   - Should explain RLS, IVFFLAT indexes

3. "How does the data flow?"
   - Should display ASCII diagram
   - Should show latency/cost breakdown

## üìà Knowledge Base Status

**Total: 40 searchable chunks**
- ‚úÖ 20 chunks: Career KB (Noah's background)
- ‚úÖ 13 chunks: Technical KB (stack, features, setup)
- ‚úÖ 7 chunks: Architecture KB (diagrams + code) ‚≠ê **ENHANCED**

---

## üîç Source Citation Improvements

### Before:
```
Sources:
- (no sources)
```

### After:
```
üìö Sources
1. **architecture_kb** - Show me the system architecture diagram (similarity: 0.89)
2. **technical_kb** - What is the tech stack behind this product? (similarity: 0.82)
3. **career_kb** - What programming languages does Noah know? (similarity: 0.76)
```

**Benefits:**
- Users see WHAT knowledge was used
- Similarity scores show confidence
- Doc IDs help identify knowledge domain
- Section titles provide context

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate:
- [x] Test all 7 architecture queries
- [x] Verify Mermaid diagrams render in Streamlit
- [x] Confirm code blocks display with syntax highlighting

### Future Enhancements:
- [ ] Add expandable code blocks for long examples
- [ ] Add "Copy Code" button to code blocks
- [ ] Add diagram zoom/pan functionality
- [ ] Track which diagrams users view most (analytics)
- [ ] Add more code examples (API routes, deployment configs)
- [ ] Add interactive diagrams (clickable components)

## üí° Key Learnings

1. **LLMs will summarize by default** - Must explicitly instruct to preserve formatting
2. **Source citations matter** - Users want to know WHERE information comes from
3. **Visual content requires special handling** - Diagrams and code need verbatim preservation
4. **Role-specific prompts are powerful** - Same content, different presentation based on audience
5. **Testing reveals gaps** - User asking "can you show code?" revealed LLM was hiding it

---

## üìù Files Modified

1. **src/agents/response_formatter.py**
   - Removed generic "Notable Outcomes" section
   - Enhanced source citations with doc_id, section, similarity

2. **src/core/response_generator.py**
   - Added explicit code/diagram preservation instructions
   - Enhanced prompts for all roles (Hiring Manager, Developer, General)

3. **data/architecture_kb.json** ‚≠ê NEW
   - 7 comprehensive items with full code and diagrams
   - JSON format (better than CSV for complex content)

4. **add_architecture_kb.py**
   - Updated to use JSON instead of CSV
   - Handles multi-line content with code blocks
