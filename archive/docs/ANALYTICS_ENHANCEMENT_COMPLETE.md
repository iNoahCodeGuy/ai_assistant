   - A/B testing framework (future)
   - Experiment table design

10. **Alerting & Monitoring**
    - Critical threshold definitions:
      - High latency: >5s
      - Low success rate: <90%
      - Cost spike: >$5/day
    - LangSmith integration for automatic tracing

## 📊 Sample Output Format

When users ask "What data is being tracked?" they now see:

```markdown
# 📊 Comprehensive Analytics & Observability System

## 🎯 1. USER INTERACTION METRICS
[SQL schema, tracked metrics table, query examples]

## 🔍 2. RAG RETRIEVAL ANALYTICS
[Retrieval quality metrics, grounding rates]

## 👤 3. ROLE-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR
[Table showing 342 queries for Software Developer, etc.]

## 💰 4. COST ANALYSIS
[Per-query cost: $0.00018, Monthly: $1.55]

[... continues through all 10 sections ...]
```

## 🎨 Formatting Improvements

### Before (Simple List)
```
The data being tracked includes user queries, responses, role selected,
latency, tokens used, success rate, similarity scores, user ratings,
contact requests, failed auth, unusual patterns, API key usage...
```

### After (Categorized & Technical)
```sql
-- Analytics by Role with Sample Output
SELECT
    role_mode,
    COUNT(*) as total_queries,
    AVG(latency_ms) as avg_latency,
    AVG(tokens_prompt + tokens_completion) as avg_tokens
FROM messages
GROUP BY role_mode;

| Role | Queries | Avg Latency | Success Rate |
|------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Software Developer | 342 | 2,134ms | 98.2% |
| Hiring Manager | 218 | 1,892ms | 99.1% |
```
